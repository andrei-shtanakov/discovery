"""The approval envelope of a brief — the mirror of a human merge.

The contract (§1, mirror rule) says `status`/`approved_by`/`approver` are
a machine reflection of git state, git being the source of truth. This
module is the reflecting half and has no effect of its own: it knows what
the envelope is, how a brief's own bytes are hashed *around* it, how it is
stamped on and withdrawn, and what an honest approval looks like to a
reader. Establishing the fact being mirrored — that a PR carrying these
bytes was merged by an authorised human — is `cli.cmd_approve` over a
`forge.Forge`; nothing here talks to a forge or reads a file.

The self-hash follows `devtools/governance/node_approval.py`: the text
with the whole approval envelope removed from its frontmatter, so the hash
computed before the signature is still the hash after it, and so a
`stale`/`draft` brief keeps the record of what its signature covered. It is
the `"sha256:<hex>"` convention of `discovery.hashing`, over the
line-ending-folded bytes, not devtools' git blob sha1: the two answer the
same question for different artefacts and are not meant to be compared.
